Overview:
This project fits various machine learning models, including
Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression,
and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to predict outcomes based on
multiple predictors. Results are evaluated using accuracy and ROC/AUC scores.
The goal is to determine which model would be best implemented in production.

Data: 
The dataset used in this project contains several
features (X1 to X8) and a target variable (Group).
