Overview:
This homework assignemnt invovled creating a deep feedforward neural network to predict wether apples were of 'good or 'bad'
quality based on seven features. After the neural network was created and fitted, a decision tree model was
created and fitted on the same data to predict the same outcome (apple quality). Performance metrics were calculated andfor each
and performance was compared.

Data: 
The dataset used in this project contains seven
features and a target variable (Quality). 
The data is available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/apple-quality
