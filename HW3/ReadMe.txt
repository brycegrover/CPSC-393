Overview:
This homework assignemnt invovled creating a deep convolutional neural network to predict whether images were of cancerous or noncancerous skin.
After the CNN was created and fitted, ResNet50 was used as a trnasfer learning model.
Performance metrics were calculated andfor each and performance was compared.
